BlobBUDDY 2.0 Stable Beta 1 Build 412 Changelog

Thank you for installing the fourth beta of BlobBUDDY 2.0, Stable Beta 1! Here are some of the major and minor changes:

+ Blob Sings is officially complete! Special shoutout to MadCreeper7611 for providing all of the integrated songs.

+ Blob Tic Tac Toe!

+ Speech bubble font size setting - You can now adjust the size of the font size of the speech bubble!

+ Blob character size setting - You can now make the Blob small, medium, or large!

+ More dialog!

+ Adjusted probabilities of some functions

+ Bug fixes

- Blob Minesweeper: Partially the reason this took so darn long to come out! (plus I lost the source code :P)

- Debug button

As with previous betas, please make sure you have blob.acs in C:\windows\msagent\chars and have .NET 2.0 Framework installed.
Failing to have either will cause the application to crash.

NOTE: As this is a beta and recently compiled, your AV may detect it as a false positive. However, this will less of a problem during the full release.
